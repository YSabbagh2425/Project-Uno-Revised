# Project Uno Revised - Space-Man
A game project that includes a hangman like game based around the 'Space-Man' but with simple objects. The game is essentially based around a max number of guesses of which you can input a letter to guess the word in screen. Each guess that is right will input letter by the amount in a word and each wrong guess adds a piece of the Space-Man until max limit has been reached. You can choose which category you would like to play around with based on a list of words behind the screen.
